# Mah Mac Setup

Tools I use to do data science daily.

## Tools

1. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

    Homebrew is a package manager for Mac, ie. not language like Python specific.

    Packages, sorted alphabetically:

        1) podman - Containerize your data science for free
        2) pre-commit - Check your code. Disable it when it annoys you
        3) pyenv - Create virtual environments when Poetry breaks
        4) pyenv-virtualenv - Can't remember, probably helps pyenv
        3) python@3.8 - No specific reason for 3.8, seems cool

2. [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

    All of my data science projects are written in Python, so Poetry is my Python package manager for each project.

3. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/])

    You need to edit code somewhere.

    Extensions, sorted alphabetically:

        1) Better TOML
        2) Code Spell Checker - I will type it wrong
        3) Docker
        4) DotEnv
        5) Jupyter
        6) markdownlint
        7) Material Icon Theme - Cool little file icons
        8) Python
        9) Python Docstring Generator - Don't manually create your function docstrings
        10) Remote Containers - I have a dream to develop with a local experience while having the compute of a big machine
        11) Todo Tree - Writing TODOs that I'll never do
        12) Trailing Spaces - Shows trailing white spaces. Possibly the greatest extension ever
        13 YAML - I've been reading a lot more YAML lately
